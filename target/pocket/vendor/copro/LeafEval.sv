// Dr. Mario depth-3 LEAF EVAL accelerator. Computes the full endgame leaf
// (shape + spawn + setup + buried + readiness_ext + vrdy + pollution + combine)
// over a 128-bcell board in ~1.5-4k clocks -- replaces ~50k cycles of 6502 walks.
//
// Cell encoding (written by the host/copro): 0 = empty, else {vir, color[1:0]}
// with color 1..3 (NES low nibble + 1). Interface:
//   write board[i]  : wr=1, waddr=i (0..127), wdata[2:0], wlnk[2:0]
//   start           : pulse start=1 (loads nothing; board regs already written)
//   done            : high when finished; sco[15:0] (signed) & win valid
//
// LINK PLANE (`blink`, this revision).  The NES playfield byte is high-nibble = link
// direction, low-nibble = colour; the wrapper used to decode only the $D virus test and
// discard the link.  `blink` carries it so gravity drops LINKED BODIES -- a capsule half
// falls with its partner until that partner is cleared -- instead of dropping every cell
// independently.  Compact per-cell gravity over-predicts cascade viruses 3.2x, which is
// what made a cascade reward unmeasurable.
//
// The link plane is a SEPARATE 3-bit array rather than a widening of `bcell`, because NO
// EVAL TERM READS LINKS: every walk below (colwalk, per-virus run/span, pollution, setup,
// and the whole CMD6/7 delta engine) reads only colour, occupancy and virus-ness through
// col_of/occ_of/vir_of.  Holding bcell at 3 bits leaves all of those 128:1 muxes
// byte-identical, so the link plane costs muxes only where links are actually read:
// S_APPLY (partner un-linking) and the gravity sweep.
//
// Link codes match the offline reference kernel (cascade_link_x.py):
//   0 NONE   1 UP   2 DOWN   3 LEFT   4 RIGHT   -- "which way the partner lies".
//
// GRAVITY ORDER.  The reference enumerates bodies row-major then STABLE-SORTS them
// lowest-first before dropping each one row, repeating to fixpoint.  A 128-entry stable
// sort is not affordable here, and it is also not necessary: body gravity is confluent
// (bodies only ever move DOWN), so any drop order reaches the same settled board.
// MEASURED, not assumed -- a plain bottom-up sweep matched the sorted reference on the
// colour, virus AND link planes plus cells/viruses/chain over 96,540 real placements
// (L11 6 games + L17 8 games, cap-1 and fixpoint):
// dr_mario_rl/tmp/rtl_chain/gravity_order_test.py.
// Bit-exact contract (validated vs the python goldens in tb_leafeval):
//   sco = 5000 - 12*maxh - 20*holes - 90*toprisk - 150*spawn + 32*setup
//         - 48*buried + 8*rdy_ext + 8*vrdy - 6*pollution + matched60   (16-bit wrap; buried color-aware + nearest-2 cap, R6 matched-cover pre-scaled @48; r47b5: vrdy 24->12; eval-winner (coef-opt2): setup 60->32, buried 30->48, rdy_ext 12->8, vrdy 12->8, matched-cover 60->48 -- held-out -12.5 / TEST -11.0 paired-median pills vs vrdy12, RTL cost 21 vs 30 bits)

// drives bl_we. The read-latency bubbles that the RAM needed already serialise the hazard
